        <p className="text-xl">
        My journey as a developer began with a passion for web design, which eventually evolved into a love for coding and problem-solving. With an extensive range of projects under my belt, I have acquired substantial expertise in working with popular frameworks like React.js, Next.js, and Redux, as well as utilizing Node.js for building server-side applications. My development arsenal also includes several libraries and styling tools like Axios for HTTP clients and CSS preprocessors via TailwindCSS, to create dynamic, interactive, and responsive component-based applications. In addition, I have honed my version control skills by using GitHub, which helps me effectively manage my codebase.  Furthemore, I have employed APIs, which enable seamless integration with external data sources and services, to make my applications even more interactive.
